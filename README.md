# Express Generator Babel

This generator simply clones a fork of the vmasto/express-babel setup and removes the initial git repository.

If you're generating this as many times as I am, it can be helpful to remove some steps.

## Installation

npm i -g express-generator-babel

## Commands

express-generator-babel name_of_destination_folder

That's it, for now. If you have a feature request, let me know.
